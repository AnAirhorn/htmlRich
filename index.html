        <h1>Areetro's Life</h1>
        <h5>Written By Arhaan</h5>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Arittro is a very odd boy. He lives in Kings Road, Ingleburn and is a multiquntillionaire. He made his money through odd methods.</p>
        <p>
            <i>"Okay. Here is how I got rich. Ooooooo *swallows finger*"</i>
            He was worth $5000 at age two and was worth six times that the next year, so in the end, how did he do it. How did he become a worldwide sensation? Find out here.

        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
            Arittro Aumi was born on the 22nd of September and has been making money since the 9th of September, 2001.
            Once born, his parents invested $5000 in his name, an odd decision that still many parents do.
            He did not know about this money in his name for three years. When he turned that age, he began selling all of his parent's assets for money.
            This turned out to be a very smart move economically, and he was almost worth $100, 000. After realising his accomplishment, the Aumis stopped their child from their selling stuff and put him on the news.
            <br></br>When he was first introduced to a camera, baby Arittro's ego trippled, and he realised that he wanted to be a rich star like Chris Pratt.
            <br>After his hundreds of camera sessions in 2014, he decided to try and make his own company, RichMan Inc. It started off terribly thogugh, and he didn't make enough money to make up for his patent. Also in the first year of it's operation, the preschooler decided what he wanted to his company to do. <b>Universe Control</b>.
        <h2>Richman Inc.'s Beginning</h2>
        <p>Despite Arittro's thoughts, controlling the universe was not as easy as he thought. He had to leave his religion and his parents (well only his mother. his father left before). </p>
